          <li>The child elements are nested insit the parent element, such as the elements within the body tags.</li>
          <li>The h1 tag is the first header. The order is important for assistive technology.</li>
          <li>ul is bullet points, ol is a numbered list. li is a line item. p is a paragraph.</li>
          <li>The img element gives info on images. src is an important attribute because it locates the image.</li>
          <li>alt gives a description of the image. You also set the width and height here.</li0>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space. The a element stands for anchor, and it it creates a link. The url for the link is href.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>inline CSS - style an element in the HTML file; quick and permanent; less flexible</li>
          <li>uses "style="</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules in the head section of the HTML; applies to all tagged page elements (ex, h1)</li>
          <li>external CSS style sheet is most common way to style a webpage; allows us to keep CSS rules in a separate file, makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>link file using <link> in the HTML's <head> after final <meta> element: <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"></li>
          <li><link> creates connection to external file; rel specifies the relationship between current and linked documents; href specifies the URL location of the external file</li>
          <li>CSS Rule Structure: selector (ex: div); div {property: value; property: value;}; declaration = propert (ex: color): value (ex: blue); wild card symbol (*) applies the rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>to combine two selectors into a single CSS rule, use a comma (ex: header, footer) rather than repeating it (Do Not Repeat Yourself aka DRY code)</li>
          <li>cd assets; touch style.css; git status; git checkout main; git checkout -b feature/add-css; VS CODE - open new style.css style sheet; add code in style.css</li>
          <li>Add Style Using Class Attributes: designate a class attribute as the selector (class selector; ex: card); adds styles to certain elements, but not all</li>
          <li>.card designates this as a class selector; review HTML to ensure the selector is assigned to the correct elements</li>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Once you add your code, it is time to save to GitHub. Make sure you are on the correct branch.</li>
          <li>Stage the changes: git add -A commits all files in the working branch, stages the changes.</li>
          <li>Commit to the repository: git commit -m; -m associates a message with the commit.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Allows users to interact with websites - first add a variable to a JS file; second add conditional logic using JS; third incorporate arrays and for loops; fourth complete the Git flow</li>
          <li>var = variable; var name = "string, of, topics" (all strings are surrounding by quotation marks); access by using the variable's name</li>
          <li>console.log(var name) adds the console.log method to the file; the method can be used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Connect the script.js file to the index.html file (similar to how we linked the CSS style sheet style.css); add a link element inside the body element</li>
          <li>Need to use Chrome DevTools to see it in action (right click in the browser, select Inspect); go to Console tab - here we see the value of the variable aka console.log method in action</li>
          <li>Control Flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script; order is very important</li>
          <li>Using conditional statements and loops control the code's execution</li>
          <li>If statements: code with only execute IF the statement meets a condition or is true</li>
          <li>Falsy: 0, -0, On, "", undefined, null, or NaN; or Boolean value of false</li>
          <li>Truthy: all other values, including Boolean value of true</li>
          <li>Multiple conditions use else if. If the first condition is truthy, that code is executed. If the first condition is false, we move to the next else if option; if its truthy, it will be executed; if not, it will move on. </li>
          <li>=== is the strict equality operator; checks if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result (true if equal, false if unequal)</li>
          <li>Have to manually change the variable value to test different values - solved w/ an Array</li>
          <li>Arrays: store a group of various data within one variable; can perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once</li>
          <li>var variable-name = ["data", "more data". "three datas"]</li>
          <li>Arrays can hold multiple types of data as well (strings, numbers, etc)</li>
          <li>Need additional information - the location of the data item in the array, aka an index</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential - the first item is 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>If we only wanted to access "more data", we would use variable-name[1];</li>
          <li>Log it in the console to see it in action console.log(variable-name[1]);</li>
          <li>for Loop uses the pattern of index to perform a task on all items in an array; much more efficient</li>
          <li>A console.log for loop can tell the computer to go through each piece of data in an array and log them to the cosnole until there are no data items left</li>
          <li>Need to know the index and the array's length</li>
          <li>Array length will tell the for loop how many times the code will run; find the array using the length property</li>
          <li>There are three important statements: 1) starting point of the loop; declare variable x and give it a value of 0 (var x = 0;); 2) the condition tells the loop how many times to run; as long as variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop keeps running; x < array.length; ; 3) final statement allows the array to iterate over each item; we know an index increases by 1 each time; x++ is short for x+1; now when the code loops, it will increase by 1</li>
          <li>Commenting out code: makes it inactive without deleting, in case you need it later. Put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task; different from a for loop because it doesn't automatically run</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses: function hellowWorld()</li>
          <li>The syntax is similar to if statements and for loops, with the code inside {  }</li>
          <li>You have to call the function in order to run the code: type the name of the function into the console; add the function name() to the point in the code where you want the function to run.</li>
